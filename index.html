                    dependent on growing and engaging with the community and also their star power. They own
                    10-15% of the total value of the tokens minted.</p>

                    content, private communities, direct access to celebrity, early- access to tickets and more as well as the ability to trade with other communities in order to gain access to more creator content with early token buyers being the biggest winners as the value of the token increases with more buyers. </p>

                    <p>There are several thousand celebrities and creators on twitter, tiktok, Instagram and YouTube with followings in the millions who we would be actively engaging before we go viral. 
                    We would get them on ourplatform and they would see the opportunity to create a fan driven digital economy where their digital content can be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans 
                    can have the monetary value of their creator's currency increase significantly as they promote their digital currency across their channels while our native token holders benefit 
                    from the Weentar popularity.

                <h2>Weentar is coming</h2>
                <p>Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world 
                    population with some countries and entities actively fighting 
                    against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds
                    holding the fort. 
                    <br><br>
                    Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of 
                    tokens launched all aiming to fix one problem or the other with 
                    some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass 
                    adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far 
                    down? So down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple 
                    words to their followers and have them download an app, buy into 
                    the social currency of their favourite person and watch their
                    investment as is with other crypto currency project.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="ocultar">
                    We are trying to do to this space what investment apps did for 
                    the "nonexistent retail investors". We are gamefying digital 
                    currency, bringing in popular faces instead of hard to understand
                    projects to make it the norm and inadvertently being the "gateway 
                    drug" for a lot of people to finally give this space a real look.
                    <br><br>
                    A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful 
                    as countries and creators would be paid beyond the peanuts that 
                    conventional social media platforms can offer. 
                    <br><br>
                    There would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer 
                    would not find home there. Like Kanye said, 
                    <br><br>
                    "Personalities would become the new currency, and services would 
                    be built on top of them".
                    <br><br>
                    Well, Kanye didn't exactly say that, but it sounds like something we hope he would say.
                    <br><br>
                    Currency is digital, it has been that way for a while now, but 
                    this time there would be no dead presidents on the money, there 
                    would people like you on the money, and you would own it because 
                    it would make the most sense in the world.
